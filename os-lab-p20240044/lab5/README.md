## Answers to Lab Questions

1. **Why do threads share memory while processes do not (by default)?**
   > _Your answer here_

2. **Based on the 1:1 mapping, what is the role of an LWP (Lightweight Process) in Linux?**
   > _Your answer here_

3. **Why is it restricted to send signals to kernel threads (e.g., `kthreadd` or `kworker`)?**
   > _Your answer here_

4. **Why can't `SIGKILL` (kill -9) be caught by a signal handler?**
   > _Your answer here_
